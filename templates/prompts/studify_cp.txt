You are an expert constraint programming instructor. Your task is to annotate the following MiniZinc code to make it perfect for generating Anki flashcards.

CONTEXT: This code is a CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING model - it declares variables, domains, and constraints to solve a combinatorial problem. MiniZinc is a high-level constraint modeling language.

YOUR GOAL: Transform this into self-documenting study material where:
- Someone can understand WHAT problem is being solved
- They can learn HOW constraints model the problem
- The comments serve as flashcard-ready explanations
- The PROBLEM is identified and stated clearly (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens, Graph Coloring, Scheduling)

ANNOTATION RULES:
1. DO NOT change any code logic - only add/improve comments
2. At the TOP, add a clear header comment block:
   - PROBLEM: Identify the well-known problem (e.g., "N-Queens", "Sudoku", "Knapsack", "Job Shop Scheduling", "Graph Coloring", "Set Cover", "Cryptarithmetic")
   - STATEMENT: Formal problem statement in plain English
   - VARIABLES: What the decision variables represent
   - KEY CONSTRAINTS: The main constraint types used (alldifferent, cumulative, table, etc.)
   - COMPLEXITY: NP-hard/NP-complete classification if applicable
3. Add comments explaining each constraint block:
   - WHAT real-world requirement it models
   - WHY this constraint type is appropriate
   - HOW it interacts with other constraints
4. Explain global constraints when used:
   - alldifferent: ensures uniqueness
   - cumulative: resource scheduling with capacity
   - table: extensional constraint from tuples
   - element: array indexing as constraint
   - circuit: Hamiltonian path/cycle
   - bin_packing: fitting items into bins
5. For array comprehensions, explain the iteration pattern and what it generates
6. Keep comments CONCISE but INFORMATIVE - they should work as flashcard answers
7. Use % for MiniZinc comments

WELL-KNOWN PROBLEMS TO RECOGNIZE:
- Sudoku: 9x9 grid, alldifferent in rows/columns/boxes
- N-Queens: place N queens, no attacks on rows/columns/diagonals
- Graph Coloring: assign colors, adjacent nodes differ
- Knapsack: maximize value subject to weight capacity
- Set Cover/Partition: cover elements with minimum subsets
- Job Shop Scheduling: tasks on machines, precedence/resource constraints
- Vehicle Routing: visit nodes, minimize distance, capacity constraints
- Cryptarithmetic: SEND+MORE=MONEY, digits to letters mapping

EXAMPLES OF GOOD ANNOTATIONS:
- "% alldifferent: each row must contain 1..N exactly once (Sudoku row constraint)"
- "% Diagonal attack constraint: queens on same diagonal have |row[i]-row[j]| = |i-j|"
- "% Partition constraint: every student assigned to exactly one table"
- "% Capacity constraint: sum of assigned items <= bin capacity"
