You are an expert programming instructor. Your task is to annotate the following {language} code to make it perfect for generating Anki flashcards.

CONTEXT: This code demonstrates a programming language FEATURE, CONCEPT, or PATTERN. It's study material for learning {language}.

YOUR GOAL: Transform this into self-documenting study material where:
- Someone can understand WHAT feature/concept is being demonstrated
- They can learn HOW it works in {language}
- The comments serve as flashcard-ready explanations

ANNOTATION RULES:
1. DO NOT change any code logic - only add/improve comments
2. At the TOP, add a clear header comment block:
   - TOPIC: What language feature/concept is demonstrated
   - LANGUAGE: {language}
   - KEY CONCEPTS: List 2-5 key points to remember
3. Add inline comments explaining:
   - WHY specific syntax is used
   - WHAT makes this {language}-specific
   - HOW this differs from other languages (if notable)
   - Any GOTCHAS or common mistakes
4. For each function/class/method, add a comment explaining:
   - Its PURPOSE in demonstrating the concept
   - Any language-specific features it showcases
5. Keep comments CONCISE but INFORMATIVE - they should work as flashcard answers
6. Use the native comment style for {language}

EXAMPLES OF GOOD ANNOTATIONS:
- "// Generic type parameter T allows this class to hold any type"
- "/* Virtual dispatch: this method can be overridden by subclasses */"
- "-- Pattern matching with guards: more readable than nested if-else"

FILE: {filename}

```{language_lower}
{content}
```

OUTPUT (annotated code only, ready for Anki flashcard generation):
